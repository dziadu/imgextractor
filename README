1. Description
=======================================

Program extracts all canvases from the root file and writes
them as images on the disk. Default width and height is 800x600,
and can be modified in per file config file. Program can generate
png (default), eps and pdf formats.
Advances usage is shown in section 4.

2. Requirements
=======================================

This software requires RootTools library installed. See

 http://github.com/dziadu/RootTools


3. Installation
=======================================

Fetch sources from git:

 git clone http://github.com/dziadu/imgextractor

Prepare build directory:

 mkdir -p imgextractor/build
 cd imgextractor/build

Run cmake to prepare Makefile. Default installing location
is /usr/local (requires root priviledges). Custom location
can be given with optional CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable
(can be removed if default location is used).
On native 32 or 64 bit systems:

 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_location

On 64 bit systems for 32 bit libraries:

 CXX="g++ -m32" cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_location

Compile and install:

 make
 make install


4. Usage
=======================================

 imgextractor [optional arguments] [filters] root.file

where:
 * optional arguments:

  --png                  : export png file (default)
  --eps                  : export eps file
  --pdf                  : export pdf file
  --width|-w pixels      : width of exported images (default 800)
  --height|-h pixels     : height of exported images (default 600)
  --dir|-d directory     : location to write output files (default
                           is the directory of root file)

 * filters

 --filter|-f canvas_name : canvas name to be exported, filters are aggregated

Using filters will expoert only canvases given in the command line,
any other will be ignored. More advanced export configuration is provided by
iecfg config file. Using filters disables parsing of iecfg files (section 5).

5. Config files
=======================================

Config file is created for each root file separetly. It is hidden file
with filename the same like root file and extension iecfg, e.g. for root
file foo.root the config file is .foo.iecfg.
Each line contain first canvas name and then options, which are:
 -          : exclude this canvas from export
 w=pixels   : eidth of export
 h=pixels   : height of export

If canvas name is '*' then options are applying to all canvase.
If '-' is used for '*' then all canvases are excluded and only
canvases for which entry exists are exported

Example:
Let's have a root file foo.root with three canvases inside:
 can_bar1
 can_bar2
 can_bar3

We want to export arr with width of 2000 but only can_bar2 with 3000, then we write:

 * w=2000
 can_bar2 w=3000

If we want to exclude can_bar3 from export

 can_bar3 -

Now, lets assume that we want only can_bar1 and can_bar3 be exported, with different sizes

 * -
 can_bar1 h=1000
 can_bar3 h=2000
